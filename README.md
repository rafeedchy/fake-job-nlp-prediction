# fake-job-nlp-prediction
In this project I took the dataset from kaggle to predict the fake job news from originals. I used transformers python package to import bert pretrained text classifier and tensorflow to predict the authenticity of job news. I used different training arguments for cross validation and optimization and lowest loss I've got is 0.063. Finally, I used sklearn's classification report to find the precision score, recall and f1 scores. In summerty we used bert pretrained model and used against our dataset and found out it greatly classifies real and fake job articles.
